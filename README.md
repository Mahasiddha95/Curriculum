Some facts about me.

[Skills](#skills) | [Current Projects](#projects) | [Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Interests](#interests) | [Contact](#contact)

A full-stack junior software developer specialising in the front-end. I've enjoyed a prosperous career in hospitality and now I'm doing what I'm passionate about - providing service to the community while writing clean and concise code. In the tech industry, I love the fact that we can positively touch the lives of so many people with a simple click and a bit of refactoring.

Having recently completed the intensive 12 weeks of Makers Academy, I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am currently looking to take on a career in the tech scene of London, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Back-End development. ***

- **Efficient** - The best result with time and resources available. I live with this status Operandi all the time. Cause of that I'm able to prioritize tasks and work through deadlines with excellent results. While working on the projects in the Makers academy program, I always reserved time to revisioned my work and create new knowledge about it.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these is a problem, only opportunities. I have been working in many different places and situations. One of my previous experiences was to go and teach every day in a different primary school in Rome Environmental issues. Hard and fun time with so many kids!
- **Disciplined** - Discipline and balance are my everyday bread. My routines are my strength and they require quite a lot of discipline.   While I was Manager at the LND Meditation centre, I have been praised many times for my commitment and dedication provided. Discipline is what allows me to really focus on my duties and goals. 
- **Inquisitive** - I love learning and I'm always learning. That's also why I wanted to change a well-established career of mine and enter into the tech industry. Being curious and humble, allows me to learn even more. Makers Academy has made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship. Something that I love since there is always something to learn.
- **Attention to detail** - While I was working in hospitality, I was raised with the idea that what makes you stand out and appreciated in your work are the details you take care of. This comes through in my coding, from seeing how the whole code fits together to finding that one tiny bug.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and craving for challenges. I do not shy away from difficult or time-consuming tasks. Patience is one of my best friends. I have been proving this on many occasions, one was at the beginning of the Makers course. While the week was going on and I didn't manage to terminate the requirements(cause of some tech issues), I moved forward and completed the first week's material in my spare time during the weekend. Time sometimes adjusts things.
- **Team-player** - Very flexible and sensible about what are the team needs. Taking a step back and observing things from different perspectives made me a great team player to work with. Also, playing video games and sports, increased my ability to communicate and work for common objectives.
- **Commitment** -I prefer to speak less and make more facts. If I say something, then becomes my commitment to maintaining it. I really value everything I say and do and I'm able to communicate efficiently for any counter time. This helped me to create very good relationships with people over the years.
